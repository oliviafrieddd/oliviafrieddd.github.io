      <h2>NAGPRA fails to give back Native American remains, sacred objects</h2>

My idea is related to the recent update of the Native Graves and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) through the “final ruling” set by the Department of the Interior. NAGPRA was set in 1990 to return the stolen remains and objects of Native peoples to their proper tribe, but has not resulted in much repatriation. However, when President Biden appointed the first Indigenous Secretary of the Interior to the Cabinet, this changed and at the beginning of this year major strides were made for repatriation. Yet there are still many funerary objects and remains that have not been returned. The National Park Service has a non-exhaustive data set of all of these human remains and funerary objects that have not been returned. The “table is an abstract of NAGPRA inventories showing the minimum number of individuals (MNI) and the number of associated funerary objects (AFO) that have not completed the NAGPRA process (i.e. still pending consultation and/or public notice prior to repatriation).

      The “table is an abstract of NAGPRA inventories showing the minimum number of individuals (MNI) and the number of associated funerary objects (AFO) that have not completed the NAGPRA process (i.e. still pending consultation and/or public notice prior to repatriation). This table includes the geographic origin and county, if known, of the human remains,” according to the NPS. While I think this can definitely provide a good baseline of data, it is not very comprehensive. For example, they have no record of what native nations these remains belong to, with the geographic location being “unknown” for many. There are also 13,000 records in the data set which might make it very difficult to comb through. Some central questions that can be answered by the dataset are: What institutions/ governmental bodies have failed to complete the NAGPRA process? and What states/ regions of the country are most responsible for failing to cooperate with NAGPRA?

      The aim of these findings would be to shed light on these issues and put pressure on the institutions to return these objects and remains. I definitely want to create a heat map and potentially two: one for remains and one for additional funerary objects as those are two different categories. I may also want to take the institution that has the highest count of stolen objects and do a specific data visualization for that entity and do further research on the potential reason for why they have these objects. In terms of sources, there are many Indigenous historians at Syracuse that have knowledge of acts like NAGPRA, for example, my professor at ESF Dr. Kimmerer. I can also contact directors/ communications contacts at the museums/ universities that have these remains and ask what their plans are. I think if I go down that route of trying to work with the museums I would probably be better off contacting the museums that have undergone the repatriation process because they would be more willing to talk to me.
