 </html> <p>oughly 34 years ago, the federal government enacted the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The law was put into place to aid in returning remains and objects stolen from Native nations by settlers who “believed that Native American people would be an extinct race, and therefore everything needed to be collected by any means necessary.” With the passing of NAGPRA it was said that the estimate for all approximately <a href=" https://www.propublica.org/article/repatriation-nagpra-museums-human-remains">300,000 remains</a> to be returned to their respective nations would be 10 years.
</p> <p>Yet, according to <a href= "https://www.propublica.org/article/repatriation-nagpra-museums-human-remains">ProPublica</a>, an investigative news non-profit organization, “the remains of more than 110,000 Native American, Native Hawaiian and Alaska Natives ancestors are still held by museums, universities and federal agencies.” Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology has only repatriated half of its holdings over this time, <a href= "https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/2/nagpra-scrut/">The Harvard Crimson</a> reported. 
</p> <p>Many anthropologists <a href= "https://www.voanews.com/a/anthropologist-challenges-return-of-native-american-remains-/7500826.html">believe</a> these objects still have a place in museums. Elizabeth Weiss, an anthropologist and professor at San Jose State University, believes that repatriation efforts negatively impact scientific research. A lack of staffing in the repatriation offices of these museums has further hindered repatriation efforts. Yet, Native nations and advocacy groups have called on museums to improve these efforts and have since worked to repatriate many more remains. Native nations believe there is still more work to be done.

      <p>On Jan. 12 the latest revision of NAGPRA took effect, and action from museums around the United States swiftly followed. The final rule was put into place to “clarify and improve upon the systematic processes for the disposition or repatriation of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony,” according to the Federal Register. 
      </p> <p>These changes were made following the appointment of Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in U.S. history, to the role of Secretary of the Interior in 2021 and have resulted in mass repatriations. Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, which has only repatriated half of its holdings since 1990, claimed in January that it will remove all funerary objects from exhibitions. According to The New York Times, the American Museum of Natural History has closed two of its major halls due to the removal of sacred objects and remains. 
      </p><p>While many Native Americans view this as “a step in the right direction,” Native nations often do not have the amount of funds or time necessary to process the thousands of remains and objects. NAGPRA's “final rule” states that museums and institutions must defer to the Native nation when it comes to the ownership of these objects, it increases the burden on the nations.

    <div class="col-sm">
      <p>Because much of the intergenerational knowledge that is passed down within a Native nation is oral tradition, without written, physical documentation that may make it even harder to process all of these requests and identify the remains. The history of forced displacement and erasure have separated nations throughout generations and makes this process even more difficult. 
      </p><p>Organizations like the Association on American Indian Affairs are actively working to aid in these efforts and federal agencies like the National Park Service are providing resources to help document where these remains are located. 
      </p><div style="min-height:527px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/l4TVh/embed.js?v=1" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/l4TVh/full.png" alt="States in the Northwest have the least amount of funerary objects with an average of about 100. California, Arizona, Florida, Alabama, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Massachusetts have the most." /></noscript></div> <p>According to the National Park Service's data, there are still 93,142 minimum individuals' remains and 658,949 associated funerary objects in institutions across the country. The state of Ohio currently has the most associated funerary objects still held in institutions with 118,090 unrepatriated objects. Illinois has the greatest number of remains with 10,764 held across the state. 
      </p> <p>Through actions like the update to NAGPRA, more remains and funerary objects have been returned to Native nations across the country daily. While Native nations agree that the passing of the final rule has made an impact, they believe more has to be done and that the United States has the responsibility to make these changes.
