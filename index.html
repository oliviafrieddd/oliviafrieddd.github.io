   <p>Israel has withdrawn its forces from Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital following a two-week operation, leaving behind scenes of devastation.

   </p>

   <p>The Israeli military confirmed the sudden pullback on Monday, saying it had completed operational activity in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/18/israeli-army-opens-fire-inside-gazas-al-shifa-hospital-officials-say">area of the hospital</a> and claiming to have killed and captured numerous Hamas fighters. Witnesses report a swath of death and destruction at the medical complex, where a large number of displaced Palestinians were sheltering.

   </p>
   <p>“Troops have completed precise operational activity in the area of the Shifa Hospital and exited the area,” the Israeli military said.

  </p>
<p>The army launched <a href=" https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/4/1/the-destruction-of-gazas-al-shifa-hospital"> the raid on Gaza's largest hospital</a>, in the northern Gaza City, on March 18. It says it was targeting Hamas fighters who were using the complex as a base.

</p>

<p>Israel forces have made similar claims throughout the war that broke out in October as they have besieged several hospitals in Gaza. Hamas has denied operating from al-Shifa or other health facilities.

</p>

<p>Al-Shifa, which endured a previous siege in November, now appears to be largely in ruins.

</p>

<p>People are trying to salvage what they can, reports Al Jazeera's Ismail al-Ghoul from al-Shifa, noting that the hospital was serving as a shelter for displaced people, as well as housing numerous staff and patients.

<p>“Buildings in all departments have been burned, and the structure of the complex has been damaged from the inside,” al-Ghoul continued. “From what we can see, it appears the occupation forces deliberately targeted the health sector and destroyed the largest medical complex in Gaza City.”

<p>Israel's military has described the raid as one of the most successful operations of its war in Gaza, which has now run for nearly six months.

</p>

<p>It claimed to have killed many Hamas fighters, including senior operatives. A spokesman said around 900 people suspected of being “militants” had been arrested, and weapons, valuable intelligence, and over $3 million in different currencies, seized.

</p>

<p>The army also insisted that the raid on the hospital had been conducted “while preventing harm to civilians, patients and medical teams”.

</p>

<p>Medical sources told Al Jazeera that hundreds of bodies were found inside the complex and in surrounding streets.

</p>

<p>Video footage circulating online showed heavily damaged and charred buildings, mounds of dirt that had been churned up by bulldozers and patients on stretchers in darkened corridors.

</p>

<p>On Sunday, the head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 21 patients had died since Israel began its siege.

</p>

<p>During the previous Israeli raid in November, the Israeli military had alleged that Hamas maintained an elaborate command and control centre inside and beneath al-Shifa, showing video of a handful of tunnels and rooms. Hamas has dismissed Israel's claims, <a href= "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-raids-gazas-al-shifa-hospital-2023-11-15/" >calling them </a> “lies and cheap propaganda”.

</p>

<p> The war began on <a href= "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/21/october-7-forensic-analysis-shows-hamas-abuses-many-false-israeli-claims" >October 7</a> following Hamas's offensive into Israel, which killed about 1,100 people and saw the armed group take nearly 250 people captive.

</p>

<p>Israel responded with an air, land and sea offensive that has killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territory's population, and driven a third of its residents to the brink of famine.
